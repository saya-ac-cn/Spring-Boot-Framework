     * associated with.

     * @param method the {@code Method} instance corresponding to
     *               the interface method invoked on the proxy instance.  The declaring
     *               class of the {@code Method} object will be the interface that
     *               the method was declared in, which may be a superinterface of the
     *               proxy interface that the proxy class inherits the method through.
     * @param args   an array of objects containing the values of the
     *               arguments passed in the method invocation on the proxy instance,
     *               or {@code null} if interface method takes no arguments.
     *               Arguments of primitive types are wrapped in instances of the
     *               appropriate primitive wrapper class, such as
     *               {@code java.lang.Integer} or {@code java.lang.Boolean}.
     * @return the value to return from the method invocation on the
     * proxy instance.  If the declared return type of the interface
     * method is a primitive type, then the value returned by
     * this method must be an instance of the corresponding primitive
     * wrapper class; otherwise, it must be a type assignable to the
     * declared return type.  If the value returned by this method is
     * {@code null} and the interface method's return type is
     * primitive, then a {@code NullPointerException} will be
     * thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance.  If the
     * value returned by this method is otherwise not compatible with
     * the interface method's declared return type as described above,
     * a {@code ClassCastException} will be thrown by the method
     * invocation on the proxy instance.
